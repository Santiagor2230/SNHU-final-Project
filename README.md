# SNHU-final-Project
# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project basically tries to analyze the data file of a grocery store that registers foods that have been vbought during the day and the code basically organizes the items into the quantity of each item as well as it demonstrates the quantity of the items through a text histogram.

# What did you do particularly well?
I believe that one of the things I did well was the links between class, function and main source which allow the code to more readable and easy to maintain if their were any issues since it required less amount of work to look for the issues.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I believe that the main part that need enchancement in my code might be the memory usage since I feel like I used alot of data structures especially with python which would have cost alot of memory to be used so in someway it never recycle the memory but add up more to it. I believe if I put more improvement to the memory it will be more efficient in data that might required more space and will eventually recycle space that might not be used or is redundant.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I believe the piece that I found most challenging to do was to analyze the file through C++ and understanding when to use an open vector or a constant vector because in some parts of the coding when I try to transfer an open vector to an array it cost issues regarding the lenght of the vector since it was undefined and therefor made it difficult to adapt to new data so I stated to learn about a resource called dynamically-allocating into an array which will allow me to make it possible to transfer data into an array but in the end I never used it so I learned something from the experience.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
There are many skill that I learned creating this project that I might transfer in the future such as understanding how to communicated between two different languages, dynamically-allocation, linking a header with a class, function sources and main sources and also understanding more about vectors and arrays.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The way I made my program maintainable, readable and adaptable was to organized everything with the correct spaces, using proper names for variables, linking my code so does not end up in one spot, making sure that there is proper notes that explains what my process is while working.
